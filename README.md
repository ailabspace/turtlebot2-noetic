# Turtlebot2 software on ROS Noetic

This repo contains notes on our process of setting up Turtlebot2 software on ROS Noetic from scratch. In most cases we have access to the desktop of Ubuntu 20.04, i.e. some GUIs have been used.

- Tested on:
  - Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS
  - ROS 1 noetic
  - Python 3.8.10
  - pip 20.0.2
  - Compute: Intel NUC, Mobile base: Kobuki, 3D Sensor: Astra
